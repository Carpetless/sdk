Hello! My name is **Pinkie Sparkle**! I don't have a cutie mark but I can do magic for your games with **Java** and **OpenGL**!

But I have a problem: **Jaime, the evil monkey** has cast a magic spell that brainwashed *my* developers, and also rebranded *my* website, *my* wiki, *my* forum, *my* slack channels. He even grabbed my twitter account!

It's terrible: this was once a peaceful place for ponies, but now there are monkeys... monkeys everywhere! His evil grin mocks all the ponies, but thanks to the open source I've forked the sdk and rebuilt the brand identity, so that all ponies can develop freely!
